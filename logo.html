            <li><i>What you are about to see is my gift to you for coming in my life and making it wonderful , Its my thank you to you for everything . Its nothing special but I hope you like it.</i></li>
            <br>
            <li><i>You are going to see my spotify account which is a holy place where only I am allowed to enter . If you are entering it , it means that I love you very much and if you ever break my heart , I dont know if i will ever recover. </i></li>
            <br>
            <li><i>Incase the spotify asks you to login , click on “sign in using facebook” then use “vedu07012009@gmail.com” and “Football1050” . After doing this again open facebook in another tab and check if you are still logged in …just precautionary things. </i></li>

                <li><b>Go to the search sign(<i class="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass"></i> the sign would be like this) and type “Happy Birthday” </b></li>
                <li><b>Go to the library option (which is below the search option) and either search or scroll down through my playlist</b></li>
            </ul>
            <br> -->
            <li>You are free to look at my songs and if you have the time ,  go through my "On Repeat" (You can access it through the seach bar and look around) and try looking at the songs I listen on a loop so we could connect at a spiritual manner. (Yes songs = spiritulity for me . Now shut up and go look at your gift , my kind mommyy) </li>
            <br>
            <li><i>I hope these rules are okay with you . If you have any queries come back online and ask me before proceeding else scroll down and click on your gift. I would recommend hovering over the logo.</i></li>
